Please develop a basic Single Page Application that searches data based on users’ ZIP code input (USA ZIP codes).
At the end you’ll need to render data about users’ State, City based on their ZIP input. You can use any free, available API for this. 
In addition please capture IP, and User Agent data. Same as above you can use either HTTP requestest or any free available API.
As a bonus you can capture HTTP Referer, UTM tags(utm1=...&utm2=... fromat) if the user comes from the outside source.

The flow should look the following way:
Step 1. The user enters their ZIP code into the input field and presses the Render button
Step 2. Rendered data requested.
Step 3. Rendered data showed (all the fields requested above).

Functionality:
ZIP code input field
Render button
Main Page Button (linking to the first step of the single page application - Home page)
IP Lookup Button on the Step 3 (once it is pressed it renders data on ISP, City, Region, and Country of the user)

For Front-end please use:
bootstrap5/tailwind
Main requirement to the UI is to be usable :)
